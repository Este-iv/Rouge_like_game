project 1.09 

for this assignment, i felt like it has been a real struggle. there when so many parts that required a lot than whast i have put in. It was also difficult to wrap my head around it. What works(partially) is most of the comands besides drop, invintory functions work fine. The issue with the invintories is that they are out of order, it follows the back pack array. the speed, combat and drop flat out do not function I had to pull out the code as it broke the program into segfaults. I did forget to add the propts for the user in the invintories but besides that. It was a tough program to get done.
