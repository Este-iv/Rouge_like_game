The code that I have crafted out of the given solution from 1.03. Does not meet the standards to what is required by the assignment. I have lacked to add the player movement as it was someting i could not wrap my head around. I had Different attemts and none worked, i have tried this last attempt to make a whole thing out of switches but nothing works... I have tried for ours all of wednesday and tuesday yet my time cannot be shown with this work.. It is about 3:46 a.m. and I am just burnt out. I can't crack it, it has gotten the best of me. Thank you for the challange.
