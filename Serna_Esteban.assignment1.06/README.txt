The code that I have crafted out of the given solution from 1.06. Was a conceptual** challange, it was hard to wrapp my head around the new code. I had to restart the code atleast once, and this turn in is the second attempt at the code. The issue i had is that i implemented thins wrong and was to down the rabbit hole to get it fixed. The code for the most part compiles right, I run into undefined issues. I think believe it is name mangaling im not sure, i manged to know come of the issue out of the way but could not resolve all of them. So the code does not run, sadly. As for the attempt on the fog of war I tried to implement it and i was stuck and could not get it to work, as could not compile as a i was going to tie it together.
