The code that I have crafted out of the given solution from 1.04. Was better than the last project yet, this one has a lot of bugs with it.. The character moves when other button are pushed, the buttons dont even do the right movement( what they are suppose to be). The Code appears to be white when loaded, once you move you can see the map, I have made it to a max of 3 rooms. before not beign able to move. The stairs flip out a little bit, i can move you though a few of maps. Things that I could not add due to the heavy bugg issue are the Look and the quit. I had the program going right and I do not know what I did but it sent it in a spiral down...  The code still partially peforms on how it should be. Some bugs i try to counter but they may still pop up
